// 📁 PROJECT: flutter_sdk/
// 🎯 Purpose: Flutter SDK for test recording & playback in dev mode

// ✅ Goal: Allow developers to visually record test flows
// ✅ Goal: Allow replay of flow JSON during integration tests or dev builds

🗺️ Dev Plan:

✅ Step 1: Define Flow Model

- flowId
- steps: List<FlowStep>
- FlowStep: action (tap, input, expect), target, value
- COMPLETED: Created flow_step.dart and test_flow.dart with JSON serialization
- ENHANCED: Added chainable expectations with ExpectCondition enum and Expectation class
- ENHANCED: Added new actions (scroll, longPress, wait) and comprehensive expectation conditions
- REORGANIZED: Split into clean model structure (enums.dart, expectation.dart, flow_step.dart, test_flow.dart)

✅ Step 2: Build RecorderOverlay (for dev mode only)

- Wrap app in overlay
- Capture taps, input
- Save step as FlowStep
- Export to JSON
- COMPLETED: Created FlowRecorderOverlay with tap and text input recording
- COMPLETED: Added RecorderController singleton for managing recording state
- COMPLETED: Added RecorderToggle widget for start/stop/export controls
- COMPLETED: Added RecorderUtils for widget target extraction
- COMPLETED: Added example app demonstrating usage
- COMPLETED: Added export functionality to JSON files in test_flows/ directory
- ENHANCED: Implemented robust hit testing with Element tree traversal
- ENHANCED: Added overlay filtering to exclude recorder UI components
- ENHANCED: Added bounds checking for accurate widget detection
- ENHANCED: Added performance monitoring with Timeline.timeSync
- ENHANCED: Improved text input capture from widget controllers
- ENHANCED: Added comprehensive documentation (HIT_TESTING.md, README.md)

✅ Step 3: Build FlowRunner

- Load flow from file
- Execute each step using WidgetTester or gestures
- Match target using key, text, type
- COMPLETED: Created FlowLoader for loading JSON flow files
- COMPLETED: Created FinderFactory for converting target strings to Finders
- COMPLETED: Created ExpectationMatcher for handling assertions
- COMPLETED: Created FlowRunner for orchestrating flow execution
- COMPLETED: Added support for all flow actions (tap, input, longPress, scroll, wait)
- COMPLETED: Added chained expectations support
- COMPLETED: Added comprehensive error handling with step context
- COMPLETED: Added example integration tests
- COMPLETED: Added sample flow JSON file
- COMPLETED: Added comprehensive documentation (README.md)

✅ Step 4: Build TargetResolver & Merge Selector Engines

- Map "@keyName" → Key
- Map "text:Login" → find.text()
- Map "button:Continue[1]" → heuristic matching
- COMPLETED: Created target_resolver.dart with support for key, text, button patterns
- COMPLETED: Merged FinderFactory and TargetResolver into single unified API
- COMPLETED: Enhanced button finder with recursive text search for nested widgets
- COMPLETED: Added robust TextFormField support in input predicates
- COMPLETED: Converted type mapping to const Map for better performance
- COMPLETED: Updated ExpectationMatcher and FlowRunner to use TargetResolver.resolve()
- COMPLETED: Removed redundant FinderFactory class to avoid code drift
- COMPLETED: Added regex expectation support with case-insensitive matching
- COMPLETED: Fixed TextFormField enabled check for proper null handling

✅ Step 5: Add StorageService

- Save/load JSON flow files
- Export path: test_flows/
- COMPLETED: Created professional StorageService class with cross-platform support
- COMPLETED: Added path_provider dependency for safe OS-managed directories
- COMPLETED: Enhanced RecorderToggle to use StorageService for saving flows
- COMPLETED: Enhanced FlowLoader with asset loading (fromAsset) and storage loading (fromStorage)
- COMPLETED: Added comprehensive error handling with StorageException
- COMPLETED: Added utility methods (listSavedFlows, deleteFlow, getFlowsDirectoryPath)
- COMPLETED: Configured pubspec.yaml to bundle test_flows as app assets
- COMPLETED: Created integration test demonstrating asset loading and storage operations

✅ Step 6: Add Dev Logger

- Log each step to console / overlay
- Show success/failure visually
- COMPLETED: Created FlowLogger with colored console output and ANSI escape codes
- COMPLETED: Added verbose control for development vs production environments
- COMPLETED: Integrated logging into FlowRunner with step-by-step execution tracking
- COMPLETED: Added screenshot-on-failure capability with automatic path generation
- COMPLETED: Added specialized log levels (info, success, error, warning, step, expectation)
- COMPLETED: Created comprehensive documentation and usage examples
- COMPLETED: Added integration tests demonstrating logging functionality
- COMPLETED: Ensured errors are always shown regardless of verbose setting
- ENHANCED: Added ANSI color support detection for cross-platform compatibility
- ENHANCED: Changed default verbose to kDebugMode (chatty in dev, quiet in CI)
- ENHANCED: Added step progress tracking ([1/5], [2/5], etc.) for better UX
- ENHANCED: Implemented real screenshot capture for integration test environments
- ENHANCED: Added file overwrite protection in StorageService.saveFlowWithName
- ENHANCED: Fixed TextFormField.enabled null handling for proper enabled detection

🔹 Step 7: Example integration_test

- Load a flow and replay it in test
- Use `flutter test integration_test/flow_test.dart`
- COMPLETED: Created comprehensive integration test suite (step7_complete_example.dart)
- COMPLETED: Added asset loading validation and error handling
- COMPLETED: Added custom flow creation and execution examples
- COMPLETED: Added storage operations testing (save/load/list flows)
- COMPLETED: Added screenshot capture verification for test failures
- COMPLETED: Created production-ready tests covering all SDK components
- COMPLETED: Validated cross-platform compatibility and error scenarios
- COMPLETED: Added performance benchmarking and memory leak prevention
- COMPLETED: Documented test flow patterns and best practices

## Final Status: FlowTest SDK 1.0.0 🎉

All 7 steps completed with production-ready enhancements:

✅ **Complete SDK**: All core features implemented and tested
✅ **Cross-platform**: iOS, Android, Web, Desktop support  
✅ **Professional logging**: ANSI colors with graceful fallback
✅ **Robust storage**: Safe file operations with collision detection
✅ **Unified selectors**: Single API for all widget finding
✅ **Visual recording**: Real-time interaction capture
✅ **Test execution**: Full WidgetTester integration
✅ **Asset management**: Bundled test flows with validation
✅ **Error handling**: Screenshots on failure with detailed logging
✅ **Production ready**: Bullet-proof error handling and cross-platform compatibility

The FlowTest SDK is ready for production use, testing, and potential publishing.
